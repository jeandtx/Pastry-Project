The project consist of a creating a virtual pastry ü•ê ü•Æ .

To do so we needed some structures

```c
typedef struct Element_str
{
    char text[50];
    struct Element_str *next;
} Element_str;

typedef struct Cake
{
    struct Element_str *order;
    struct Taste_Stack *s_tastes;
} Cake;

typedef struct Element_cake
{
    struct Cake *cake;
    struct Element_cake *next;
} Element_cake;

typedef struct Order_Queue
{
    struct Element_str *list;
} Order_Queue;

typedef struct Taste_Stack
{
    struct Element_str *tastes;

} Taste_Stack;

typedef struct Tasting_Queue
{
    struct Element_cake *queue;
} Tasting_Queue;
```

The client is choosing an order from the menu and the order is send in a queue. Then cakes are build by the chef and send to a tasting queue. The client can now choose how many parts he wants to taste.

## Difficulties

- It was hard to deal with structures in structures and even queues and stacks inside

## What we learned

- We learned to deal with these structures
- To finish a project in a small time with a team of 4. It need a lot of organisation and skills
